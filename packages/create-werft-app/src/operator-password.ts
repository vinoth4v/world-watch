/**
 * One operator password, for every app Werft has delivered.
 *
 * The single-operator gate means each app holds a password hash in its own
 * environment. Left alone, that means N passwords to remember and no way to
 * change any of them without visiting N dashboards. So the hash is kept once,
 * here, and pushed everywhere:
 *
 *   ~/.config/werft/password-hash   the standing value, read by the scaffold
 *   WERFT_PASSWORD_HASH (secret)    so runner-scaffolded apps get it too
 *   every app's Vercel environment  so apps already delivered accept it
 *
 * What is stored is the scrypt hash, never the password. It is the same value
 * the app itself stores, so keeping it buys an attacker nothing an app's own
 * environment would not, and the plaintext is never written to disk at all.
 *
 * The tradeoff is deliberate and worth naming: one hash across the fleet means
 * one password opens every app, and an environment leak in the weakest app
 * exposes the credential for all of them. That is the operator's stated choice
 * — one standing sign-in — and `create-werft-app --password` still gives a
 * single app its own.
